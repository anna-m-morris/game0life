# Game0Life

An exercise in algorithms; Conway's game of life is a zero player game in that the progression of the cell state is determined by the initial state which the user sets and then runs autonomously according to the rules. 

1: Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2: Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3: All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
